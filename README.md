# TicTacToe
The classic Tic-Tac-Toe game (also called Noughts and Crosses) or Xs and Os in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three O's or three X's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares. 

# Minimax Algorithm
In this code, I've used minimax algorithm to help the computer where to go for the next move and win the puzzle.

Minimax is a kind of backtracking algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that your opponent also plays optimally.

I took reference from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI) wonderful video resource for implementing minimax algorithm.
